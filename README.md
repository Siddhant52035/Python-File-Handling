# Python-File-Handling
This is a project centered around File handling in python.
Python lets us read and write to a file, append and remove things.
So, Basically the core idea was to create a functional database for a local costume rental store that cannot afford to invest in database servers.
So, this python program, makes a bill everytime a customer rents or returns a costume and adds fine,etc and stores them as individual .txt files.
Overall, it is a fully functional local database without the gui part.
